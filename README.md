# dynamic_clamp
A fast, microcontroller-based dynamic clamp system

The system (its function, its properties, and its place in contemporary neuroscience) is described in detail 
in this paper: Niraj S. Desai, Richard Gray, and Daniel Johnston. A dynamic clamp on every rig. eNeuro (2017).

The website www.dynamicclamp.com includes detailed instructions on how to assemble and use the system.

This site (github.com) houses the associated software (Arduino, Processing, Matlab).
