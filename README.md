# dynamic_clamp
A fast, microcontroller-based dynamic clamp system

The system was introduced in this paper: Niraj S. Desai, Richard Gray, and Daniel Johnston. A dynamic clamp on every rig. eNeuro (DOI:10.1523/ENEURO.0250-17.2017).

The website www.dynamicclamp.com includes detailed instructions on how to assemble and use the system. It includes recent updates.

This site (github.com) houses most of the associated software (Arduino, Processing, Matlab).

Christian Rickert has written some alternative software (dyClamp and pyClamp) with extended functionality, including a Python-based control GUI. His software is described at https://dynamicclamp.com/python-alternative/ and is available through his Github account https://github.com/christianrickert.
